### Introduction
[_Ilexparaguariensis_](https://powo.science.kew.org/taxon/urn:lsid:ipni.org:names:315555-2) is an evergreen shrub or tree native to the subtropical forests of Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay, and Argentina that can grow up to forty-nine feet tall. It’s a plant species of the genus ilex (or “holly”) that contains caffeine as well as other alkaloid components, and it has stimulant, diuretic, antioxidant, and antimicrobial properties that made it attractive to both the indigenous Guaraní people and to Spanish colonial settlers. After being dried, roasted, and powdered, mate leaves are used to prepare a hot or cold beverage, also known as mate or Paraguayan Tea. The loose powder is typically steeped in hot water and strained through a <span data-mouseover-image-zoomto="893,847,445,374">metallic straw</span>, or bombilla, shared by many people, passing from mouth to mouth. During the 19th century, the drink became associated with South American *gauchos*. The same mate and bombilla are shared in social gatherings, a habit that has endured despite recent public health campaigns to prevent COVID-19 pandemic. The flower is beautiful and pink.

## Maps! 

Now we're going to code a map. "Esri_WorldPhysical" shows a world map without modern political borders.

<param ve-map basemap="Esri_WorldPhysical">

New paragraph. Use center to focus the map on a specific location. Zoom zooms in! You can also get coordinates on Google Maps. 
<param ve-map center="Q733" zoom=3>


## new image

trying to annotate an image. in order to annotate, click on the little comment thing with the pen. then press shift and command, and then draw a rectangle with the mouse. you can add annotations. up to 5 annotations should be aliright, but don't do more. And then you can play the slideshow buttun, which will present the annotations to the reader! it doesn't support more than one image (so no galleries or comparisons)
